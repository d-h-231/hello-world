# hello-world
trying really hard
to learn how to web develop...there's so many things out there!
I'm using github to develop a publication website (think newspaper). I need to develop widgets to place on the HomePage.
github will help me keep track of my changes. I can record why I did what I did so that I actually retain what I learn from random google searches...
